Exponential Growth Sequences
At Socialytics, we are interested in simulating the exponential growth of an influencer's followers over a certain period with an adjustable growth factor.

Assignment
Complete the exponential_growth function. Given the initial followers count n, growth factor factor, and number of days days, return a list containing the exponential growth of followers for each day.

For example:

- Initial followers: 10
- Growth factor: 2
- Days: 4

Growth sequence: [10, 20, 40, 80, 160]
